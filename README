C_COUNT counts C-language source statements, and summarizes statistics about
the relative amount of commentary, whitespace, etc.

It provides options to extend its usefulness, accommodating C-preprocessor
definitions that would confuse a simpler line-counter, and for displaying
non-graphic characters, etc.

The program runs on a variety of UNIX systems, VMS and MSDOS.
