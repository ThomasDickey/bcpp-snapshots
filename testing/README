The test-cases for C_COUNT are contrived to use all of the different switches
defined for this utility. The results of each test are shown in the test-
output, as well as any differences (should be none) from the reference-output.

The test scripts assume that C_COUNT is in the parent directory.  Scripts
are system-specific:

	run_test.bat - MSDOS script

	run_test.dcl - VMS script (doesn't use ".com" suffix because that
		would create too many problems on MSDOS).

	run_test.sh - UNIX script (invoked from the parent directory when
		you do a "make check").
