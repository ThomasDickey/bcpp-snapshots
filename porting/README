C_COUNT/PORTING

The files in this directory are needed on MSDOS or VMS to build C_COUNT.  If
you need them, copy them into the top-level directory before making the
program.

	getopt.c, getopt.h - a free version of getopt function for systems that
		don't already have it (i.e., MSDOS, VMS).  Some systems that
		support auto-configuration may need these files; you'll have to
		edit the makefile in that case.

	wildcard.c - utility routines for expanding wildcards on non-UNIX
		systems (VMS, MSDOS).

	descrip.mms - makefile for VAX C.

	turboc.mak - makefile for Turbo C/C++ on MSDOS.
